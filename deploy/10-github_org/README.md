# GitHub Organization Bootstrap

## Pre-Requisites

- A GitHub organization to bootstrap
- An authenticated GitHub client with appropriate permissions. Some scopes (organization ones) are _unusual_ and require to be specifically requested when authenticating with GitHub CLI. You can use the following command to authenticate with the required scopes:

```sh
gh auth login --scopes 'read:project gist read:org repo workflow admin:org'
```

## Missing IaC

Some parts of the GitHub organization are not managed by IaC, as GitHub does not provide a way to manage them through Pulumi nor Terraform.
